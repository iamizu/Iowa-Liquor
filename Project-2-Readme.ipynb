    "###                          Report of current liquor sales in Iowa and projections for the rest of the year.\n",
    "###                                                      Tax Board  to inform their decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "###                            Here are the steps I took to make sure I have the dataset ready for modeling \n",
    "               \n",
    "               \n",
    "### 1. Data Gathering\n",
    "This was actually provided by the state of Iowa, due to the size of the dataset I had to make do with just 10% of it because it’s sizeable for my experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Cleaning\n",
    "I took different steps to get the dataset up and running and here are my steps:\n",
    "Knowing that I will be doing lots of  numerical practices made me want to take a look at the data structure so as to know the story it’s telling, know what type of data I have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploratory Date Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "This involves me finding out what the industry  is about in relation to Iowa, I needed that idea in other to figure out as much information about liquor vendors in Iowa as possible, the rate of  liquor consumption  within the state, the state cost of all liquor bottles and how much they are retailed for.\n",
    ".ligquor with highest state cost price sales very low, this is true because the higher the price less it sales off the shelve. so so it cost more to buy liquor with high state cost price abd it's 0.75 litres and vendors tend to sale at a very high price and people rarely buys them.\n",
    ".I created a new column which calculates the profit made by each vendor and i was hoping to make it my target variable such dependent variable can be considered when making changes by the iowa state Tax Board\n",
    ".so looking at the sales of each vendor in 2015, the largest sales was made around August 2015 in polk county and the state cost was 18.38 and sold most bottles too.\n",
    ". About 218594 bottles were sold for the entire year of 2015 80% of which falls below avergae state bottle cost meaning cheaper liquor sales off more compared to ones with high price.\n",
    ". Adam county sold less on average in terms of how many bottle sold and on the average Fermont did so well based on bottles sold but it doesn't make them highest in profit or sales in dollars, but on just sum polk county made the most bottle sales, sales in dollars and in profit\n",
    "So I looked at the state bottle that has the highest state cost in dollars retailed at 637.50 only which make sense the vendor don't sell them often and so it's pricy so they try to maximize profit when they do sell it so one vendor seem to makes this sale.\n",
    "so looking at the sales of each vendor in 2015, the largest sales was made around August 2015 in polk county and the state cost was 18.38 and sold most bottles too.\n",
    "So in 2016 on average Dallas county sold more bottles but when it comes to sum up sales polk county came first, so i decided to look further just to understand these trend with polk county and found out they are the largest county in iowa which explains why they sell more and have more vendors, however the more vendor they have the sales spreads out.\n",
    "so i plotted a histogram to understand sales base on date and it seem most sales happened during  middle of the year\n",
    ". I noticed that state bottle that has the highest state cost in dollars retailed at a very high price which make sense the vendor don't sell them often and so it's pricy so they try to maximize profit when they do sell it so one vendor seem to makes this sale.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. Modeling\n",
    "filtered  my observation with sales that occurred in 2015 from January through March and also that of December. Aggregated each month based on sales and concatenated all that sales in one data frame. So one null value was observed which I decided to set to zero because it has less significance.\n",
    "I checked for correlation significance and so checked for outliers which seem to occur in December total sales\n",
    "\n",
    "so as to understand relationships between my response variable and predictors I looked at their correlation using heat map to know the strength of their correlation\n",
    "Knowing that I have a continuous predictors was the reason for choosing my model to work with \n",
    "\n",
    "So Knowing that I would be able to print out a variety of summary statistics, metrics, and properties of the model using the model summary() function. and I also want to see the R-squared, Number of observations, Coefficients for the variables and the intercept (const),\n",
    "Standard errors of the coefficients, t-statistics, p-values, and confidence intervals. Which makes it pretty good to work with.\n",
    "Fitting a liner regression using ststs model\n",
    "First we load the statsmodels api module, which contains the ordinary least squares OLS model class.\n",
    "We manually make a new column for the intercept in our design matrix  XX .\n",
    "The  yy  target variable comes before the  XX  predictor\n",
    "The data is provided during the instantiation of the model object, then fit is called without the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Results\n",
    "Model One;\n",
    "Stats model results for three predictor;\n",
    "For a 1-unit increase in Jan (holding constant Feb), there is a 0.6899 increase in Total_yr\n",
    "For a 1-unit increase in Feb (holding constant Jan), there is a 0.4672 increase in Total_yr\n",
    "A 1 unit increase in variable March corresponds to a 0.3458 unit increase in the estimate of Total_y\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I reduced my predictors to two and here are my results;\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 1-unit increase in Jan (holding constant Feb), there is a 0.8958 increase in Total_yr\n",
    "For a 1-unit increase in Feb (holding constant Jan), there is a 0.6774 increase in Total_yr\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Two;\n",
    "Fitting linear Regression sk-learn model with three predictor\n",
    "As `Jan sales` increases by 1, we expect `Total sales ` to increase by 0.69. \n",
    "As `Feb sales` increases by 1, we expect `Total sales ` to increase by 0.47.\n",
    "As `March sales` increases by 1, we expect `Total sales ` to increase by 0.35\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Three;\n",
    "train_test_split method using 50/50\n",
    "So using train_test_split method I got the same results.\n",
    "Before we start creating models, we need to split our data into a training set and a test set\n",
    "Remember that the goal of predictive modeling is to predict future outcomes The best way to test our models is to see how well they do on data they have not yet seen.\n",
    "Because  train/test split they are the most basic type of \"hold-out\" validation.\n",
    "Testing data can represent \"future\" data; for prediction-oriented models, it's critical to ensure that a model that is performing well on current data will likely perform well on future data.\n",
    "It can help diagnose and avoid overfitting via model tuning and It can also improve the quality of our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Four;\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation Using K=5\n",
    "It takes the idea of a single train/test split and expands it to multiple tests across different train/test splits of your data\n",
    "The function cross_val_score returns the R2 for each testing set.\n",
    "Alternatively, the function cross_val_predict returns the predicted values for each data point when it's in the testing slice.\n",
    "Below are the predictions for Cross_val_predict \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross_Val_Predicted : 0.98\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are my cross_val_score;\n",
    "\n",
    "i.The model has an R2 of 0.964, which means that the three predictor variables I have chosen explain 96.4% of the variance in the target variable not explained by the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.The model has an R2 of 0.948, which means that the three predictor variables I have chosen explain 94.8% of the variance in the target variable not explained by the baseline model 3.The model has an R2 of 0.988, which means that the three predictor variables I have chosen explain 98.8% of the variance in the target variable not explained by the baseline model\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.The model has an R2 of 0.992, which means that the three predictor variables I have chosen explain 99.2% of the variance in the target variable not explained by the baseline model\n",
    "\n",
    "iv.The model has an R2 of 0.942, which means that the three predictor variables I have chosen explain 94.2% of the variance in the target variable not explained by the baseline model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "looking at the limitations of my model I have some real doubt in my result due to errors in my model, my model seem to underpredict which I believe is as a result of strong correlation among the independent variables(predictors) of my choice. my training score is higher than my test score in most result, but they are some other things to also put in mind based on my coefficient of determination R2 which seem to be in the 90% range and also lower coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a reminder that it’s important to take a good look at your data BEFORE you start your modeling journey. If you don’t you risk drawing the wrong conclusions\n",
    "However i would advice that the Board consider not increasing the state tax rate based on my model outcome.\n",
